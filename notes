Create Template - This flow sucks for sharing templates with others (but it's what we got)
- template branch exists
-- update that branch
- template branch does not exist
-- create branch for template
-- commit changes
- push changes for branch up OVER any existing branch on the remote 

Create Template - Better job of handling sharing with others
- template branch exists
-- update that branch
- template branch does not exist
-- create branch for template
-- commit changes
- push changes
-- push fail
--- fetch fail
---- no network
----- try again later
----- done
---- tell the user we have no idea, 
----- done
--- fetch success
--- merge success
---- push
--- merge fail
---- have use resolve conflicts
---- commit
---- push
-- push success
--- done

-- copy it's contents to the location specified
- template branch does not exist
-- fetch success
-- if template branch exists
--- check out that branch
--- copy it's contents to the location specified
-- else
--- tell 'em we aint got that
-- fetch fails
--- tell 'em we aint got that
